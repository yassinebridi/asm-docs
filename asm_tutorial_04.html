Interrupts can be seen as a number of functions. These functions make
the programming much easier, instead of writing a code to print
a character you can simply call the interrupt and it will do everything
for you. There are also interrupt functions that work with disk drive
and other hardware. We call such functions <B>software interrupts</B>.
<BR><BR>
Interrupts are also triggered by different hardware,
these are called <B>hardware interrupts</B>. Currently we are interested
in <B>software interrupts</B> only.
<BR><BR>

<BR>
To make a <B>software interrupt</B> there is an <B>INT</B> instruction,
it has very simple syntax:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>INT value</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Where <B>value</B> can be a number between 0 to 255 (or 0 to 0FFh),<BR>
generally we will use hexadecimal numbers.
<BR>
You may think that there are only 256 functions, but that is not correct.
Each interrupt may have sub-functions.
<BR>
To specify a sub-function <B>AH</B> register should be set before calling
interrupt.<BR>
Each interrupt may have up to 256 sub-functions
(so we get <NOBR>256 * 256 = 65536</NOBR> functions).
In general <B>AH</B> register is used, but sometimes other registers
maybe in use. Generally other registers are used to pass parameters
and data to sub-function.<BR><BR>

The following example uses <B>INT 10h</B> sub-function <B>0Eh</B> to
type a "Hello!" message. This functions displays a character on
the screen, advancing the cursor and scrolling the screen as necessary.

; The sub-function that we are using
