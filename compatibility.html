syntax of emu8086 is fully compatible with all major assemblers including
<I>MASM</I> and <I>TASM</I>; &nbsp; though some directives are unique to this assembler.
 &nbsp;
If required to compile using any other assembler you may need to comment out
these directives, and any other directives that start with a '<B>#</B>' sign:

<pre><font face="fixedsys">#make_bin#
#make_boot#
#cs=...#
         etc...</font></pre>


<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

emu8086 ignores the <B>ASSUME</B> directive.
&nbsp; Manual attachment of <B>CS:</B>, <B>DS:</B>, <B>ES:</B>
or <B>SS:</B> segment prefixes is preferred, and required by emu8086 when data is
in segment other then <B>DS</B>. For example:



<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">mov ah, [bx]        <FONT COLOR=green>; read byte from DS:BX</FONT>
mov ah, es:[bx]     <FONT COLOR=green>; read byte from ES:BX</FONT></FONT></PRE>
<BR>



<HR>

emu8086 does not require to define segment when you compile
segmentless <B>COM</B> file, however <I>MASM</I> and <I>TASM</I> may require this,
for example:<BR><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=10><TR><TD>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
name test

CSEG    SEGMENT     ; code segment starts here.

ORG 100h

start:  MOV AL, 5   ; some sample code...
        MOV BL, 2
        XOR AL, BL
        XOR BL, AL
        XOR AL, BL

        RET

CSEG    ENDS        ; code segment ends here.

END     start       ; stop compiler, and set entry point.</FONT></PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<BR><BR>

Entry point for <B>COM</B> file should always be at <B>0100h</B>, however in <I>MASM</I> and <I>TASM</I> you may need to manually
set an entry point using <B>END</B> directive even if there is no way to set it to some other location.
emu8086 works just fine, with or without it; however error message is generated if entry point is set but it is not 100h (the starting offset for com executable).
the entry point of com files is always the first byte.

<BR><BR>


If you compile this code with Microsoft Assembler or with Borland Turbo Assembler, you should get <B>test.com</B> file (11 bytes), right click it and select <B><NOBR>send to</NOBR></B> and <B>emu8086</B>.
You can see that the disassembled code doesn't contain any directives and it is identical
to code that emu8086  produces even without all those tricky directives.

<BR><BR>

    emu8086 has almost 100% compatibility with other similar 16 bit assemblers.
    The code that is assembled by emu8086 can easily be assembled with other assemblers such as TASM or MASM,
    However not every code that assembles by TASM or MASM can be assembled by emu8086.

A template used by emu8086  to create <B>EXE</B> files is fully compatible
with <I>MASM</I> and <I>TASM</I>.

<BR><BR>

The majority of <B>EXE</B> files produced by <I>MASM</I> are identical to those produced by <I>emu8086</I>.
 &nbsp;
 However, it may not be exactly the same as TASM's executables because
<I>TASM</I> does not calculate the checksum, and has slightly different EXE file structure, but in general it
produces quite the same machine code.

<BR><BR>
NOTE:  there are several ways to encode the same machine instructions for the 8086 CPU,
so generated machine code may vary when compiled on different compilers.

emu8086 integrated assembler supports shorter versions of <B>byte ptr</B> and <B>word ptr</B>,
these are: <B>b.</B> and <B>w.</B><BR><BR>

For <I>MASM</I> and <I>TASM</I> you have to replace <B>w.</B> and <B>w.</B> with
<B>byte ptr</B> and <B>word ptr</B> accordingly.<BR><BR>

For example:
<pre><font face="fixedsys">lea bx, var1
mov word ptr [bx], 1234h ; works everywhere.
mov w.[bx], 1234h        ; same instruction / shorter emu8086 syntax.
hlt

var1  db  0
var2  db  0

<B>LABEL</B> directive may not be supported by all assemblers, for example:

<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">	  TEST1 LABEL BYTE
	  ; ...
	  LEA DX,TEST1
</FONT></PRE>

The above code should be replaced with this alternative construction:

<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">          TEST1:
          ; ...
	  MOV DX, TEST1
</FONT></PRE>

The offset of <B>TEST1</B> is loaded into <B>DX</B> register. this solutions works for the majority of leading assemblers.
