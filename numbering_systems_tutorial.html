<!--
There are many ways to represent the same numeric value, previously
homo sapiens was using sticks to count, so number 5 was represented as:<BR>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; |</B><BR>
(five sticks).
<BR><BR>


Using sticks to count isn't a good idea, modern decimal system is much better,
don't you think?
-->


There are many ways to represent the same numeric value. Long ago, humans used
sticks to count, and later learned how to draw pictures of sticks in the ground
and eventually on paper. So, the number 5 was first represented as:
<NOBR>
<STRONG>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG></NOBR>(for five sticks).

<BR><BR>
Later on, the Romans began using different symbols for multiple numbers
of sticks:<NOBR>
<STRONG>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG></NOBR>still meant three sticks,
&nbsp;but a&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>V&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG>
now meant five sticks,
and an&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>X&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG> was used to represent ten of them.

<BR><BR>
Using sticks to count was a great idea for its time. And using
symbols instead of real sticks was much better. &nbsp;

<!--
One of the best ways to represent a number today is by using the modern decimal system.
Why? Because it includes the major breakthrough of using a symbol to
represent the idea of counting <I><STRONG>nothing</STRONG></I>. &nbsp;
About 1500 years ago in India, <STRONG>zero</STRONG>
(<STRONG>0</STRONG>) was first used as a number. &nbsp;
It was later used in the Middle East as the Arabic,
<I>sifr</I>. And was finally introduced to the West as the Latin, <I>zephiro</I>.

&nbsp;Soon you'll see just how valuable an idea this is for all modern number systems.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Decimal System</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>

<!--We, humans use decimal representation to count.
In decimal system there are 10 digits:-->

Most people today use decimal representation to count.
In the decimal system there are 10 digits:

<BR><BR>
<B>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</B><BR><BR>
These digits can represent any value, for example:<BR>
<B>754</B>.<BR>
The value is formed by the sum of each digit, multiplied by
the <B>base</B> (in this case it is <B>10</B> because there are
10 digits in decimal system) in power of digit position (counting from zero):<BR><BR>
<!-- 7 * 10^2 + 5 * 10^1 + 4 * 10^0  =  700 + 50 + 4 = 754 -->
<IMG SRC="img/num1.gif" WIDTH=448 HEIGHT=108>
<BR><BR>
Position of each digit is very important!
for example if you place "7" to the end:<BR>
<B>547</B><BR>
it will be another value:<BR><BR>
<!-- 5 * 10^2 + 4 * 10^1 + 7 * 10^0  =  500 + 40 + 7 = 547 -->
<IMG SRC="img/num2.gif" WIDTH=448 HEIGHT=108>

<BR><BR>
<B>Important note:</B> any number in power of zero is 1, even
zero in power of zero is 1:<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Binary System</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>
Computers are not as smart as humans are (or not yet),
it's easy to make an electronic machine with two states: <B>on</B> and <B>off</B>,
or <B>1</B> and <B>0</B>.<BR>
Computers use binary system, binary system uses 2 digits:
<BR><BR>
<B>0, 1</B><BR><BR>

And thus the <B>base</B> is <B>2</B>.

<BR><BR>
Each digit in a binary number is called a <B>BIT</B>, 4 bits form a <B>NIBBLE</B>,
8 bits form a <B>BYTE</B>, two bytes form a <B>WORD</B>, two words form
a <B>DOUBLE WORD</B> (rarely used):<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="img/num4.gif" WIDTH=339 HEIGHT=126>

<BR><BR>
There is a convention to add <B>"b"</B> in the end of a binary number, this way we
can determine that 101b is a binary number with decimal value of 5.

<BR><BR>
The binary number <B>10100101b</B> equals to decimal value of 165:
<BR><BR>

<!--
10100101b =
 =  1 * 2^7 + 0 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 =
 =  128     + 0       + 32      + 0       + 0       + 4       + 0       + 1 = 165

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Hexadecimal System</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>
Hexadecimal System uses 16 digits:<BR><BR>
<B>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</B><BR><BR>

And thus the <B>base</B> is <B>16</B>.
<BR><BR>
Hexadecimal numbers are compact and easy to read.<BR>
It is very easy to convert numbers from binary system to hexadecimal system and vice-versa,
every nibble (4 bits) can be converted to a hexadecimal digit using this table:

There is a convention to add <B>"h"</B> in the end of a hexadecimal number, this way we
can determine that 5Fh is a hexadecimal number with decimal value of 95.<BR>
We also add <B>"0"</B> (zero) in the beginning of hexadecimal numbers that begin with a letter (A..F),
for example <B>0E120h</B>.

<BR><BR>
The hexadecimal number <B>1234h</B> is equal to decimal value of 4660:<BR><BR>
<!--
1 * 16^3 + 2 * 16^2 + 3 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0 = 4096 + 512 + 48 + 4 = 4660

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Converting from Decimal System to Any Other</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>

In order to convert from decimal system, to any other system, it is required
to divide the decimal value by the <B>base</B> of the desired system, each time
you should remember the <B>result</B> and keep the <B>remainder</B>, the
divide process continues until the <B>result</B> is zero.<BR><BR>
The <B>remainders</B> are then used to represent a value in that system.

<BR><BR>

Let's convert the value of <B>39</B> (base <U>10</U>) to
<I>Hexadecimal System</I> (base <U>16</U>):
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="img/num8.gif" WIDTH=420 HEIGHT=185>

<BR><BR>

As you see we got this hexadecimal number: <B>27h</B>.<BR>
All remainders were below <B>10</B> in the above example, so
we do not use any letters.

<BR><BR>

Here is another more complex example:<BR>
let's convert decimal number <B>43868</B> to hexadecimal form:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="img/num9.gif" WIDTH=419 HEIGHT=310>

<BR><BR>
The result is <B>0AB5Ch</B>, we are using <A HREF="#hextable">the above table</A>
to convert remainders over <B>9</B> to corresponding letters.

<BR><BR>
Using the same principle we can convert to binary form (using <B>2</B> as the divider),
or convert to hexadecimal number, and then convert it to binary number using
<A HREF="#hextable">the above table</A>:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="img/num10.gif" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=88>

<BR><BR>
As you see we got this binary number: <B>1010101101011100b</B>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Signed Numbers</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>

There is no way to say for sure whether the hexadecimal byte <B>0FFh</B> is
positive or negative, it can represent both decimal value "<B>255</B>" and "<B>- 1</B>".

<BR><BR>

8 bits can be used to create <B>256</B> combinations (including zero), so we simply
presume that first <B>128</B> combinations (<B>0..127</B>) will represent positive numbers
and next <B>128</B> combinations (<B>128..256</B>) will represent negative numbers.

<BR><BR>
In order to get "<B>- 5</B>", we should subtract <B>5</B> from the number of
combinations (<B>256</B>), so it we'll get: <NOBR><B>256 - 5 = 251</B>.</NOBR>

<BR><BR>

Using this complex way to represent negative numbers has some meaning, in math
when you add "<B>- 5</B>" to "<B>5</B>" you should get zero.<BR>
This is what happens when processor adds two bytes <B>5</B> and <B>251</B>,
the result gets over <B>255</B>, because of the overflow processor gets zero!
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="img/num11.gif" WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=191>

<BR><BR>
When combinations <B>128..256</B> are used the high bit is always <B>1</B>, so
this maybe used to determine the sign of a number.

<BR><BR>
The same principle is used for <B>words</B> (16 bit values),
16 bits create <B>65536</B> combinations, first 32768 combinations (<B>0..32767</B>)
are used to represent positive numbers, and next 32768 combinations (<B>32767..65535</B>)
represent negative numbers.

There are some handy tools in emu8086 to convert numbers, and make
calculations of any numerical expressions, all you need is a
click on <B>Math</B> menu:

<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="img/num12.gif">

<BR><BR>

<B>Base converter</B> allows you to convert numbers from any system and
to any system. Just type a value in any text-box, and the value
will be automatically converted to all other systems. You can work both
with <B>8 bit</B> and <B>16 bit</B> values.

<BR><BR>

<B>Multi base calculator</B> can be used to make calculations between
numbers in different systems and convert numbers from one system to another.
Type an expression and press enter, result will appear in chosen numbering system.
You can work with values up to <B>32 bits</B>. When <B>Signed</B> is checked
evaluator assumes that all values (except decimal and double words) should be treated as
<B>signed</B>. Double words are always treated as signed values, so
<B>0FFFFFFFFh</B> is converted to <B>-1</B>.<BR>
For example you want to calculate: <FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
<NOBR>0FFFFh * 10h + 0FFFFh</NOBR></FONT>
(maximum memory location that can be accessed by 8086 CPU).
If you check <B>Signed</B> and <B>Word</B> you will get
<FONT FACE="Fixedsys">-17</FONT> (because it is evaluated as
<FONT FACE="Fixedsys"><NOBR>(-1) * 16 + (-1) </NOBR></FONT>. To make
calculation with unsigned values uncheck <B>Signed</B>
so that the evaluation will be <FONT FACE="Fixedsys"><NOBR>65535 * 16 + 65535</NOBR></FONT>
and you should get <FONT FACE="Fixedsys">1114095</FONT>.
<BR>You can also use the <B>base converter</B> to convert
non-decimal digits to signed decimal values, and
do the calculation with decimal values (if it's easier for you).

<BR><BR>
These operation are supported:<BR>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
~       not (inverts all bits).
*       multiply.
/       divide.
%       modulus.
+       sum.
-       subtract (and unary -).
<<      shift left.
>>      shift right.
&       bitwise AND.
^       bitwise XOR.
|       bitwise OR.
</FONT></PRE>
<BR>

Binary numbers must have "<B>b</B>" suffix, example:<BR>
<FONT FACE="Fixedsys"> 00011011b</FONT><BR><BR>

Hexadecimal numbers must have "<B>h</B>" suffix, and start with a zero<BR>
when first digit is a letter (A..F), example:<BR>
<FONT FACE="Fixedsys"> 0ABCDh</FONT><BR><BR>

Octal (base 8) numbers must have "<B>o</B>" suffix, example:<BR>
<FONT FACE="Fixedsys"> 77o</FONT><BR><BR>
