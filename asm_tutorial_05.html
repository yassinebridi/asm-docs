To make programming easier there are some common functions that can
be included in your program. To make your program use functions defined
in other file you should use the <B>INCLUDE</B> directive followed by
a file name. Compiler automatically searches for the file in the same
folder where the source file is located, and if it cannot find the file
there - it searches in <B>Inc</B> folder.

<BR><BR>
Currently you may not be able to fully understand the contents of the <B>emu8086.inc</B>
(located in <B>Inc</B> folder), but it's OK, since you only need to understand
what it can do.

<BR><BR>
To use any of the functions in <B>emu8086.inc</B> you should have the following line
in the beginning of your source file:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
include 'emu8086.inc'
</FONT>


<BR><BR>

<HR>

<BR>
<B>emu8086.inc</B> defines the following <B>macros</B>:<BR><BR>
<UL>

<LI><B>PUTC char</B> - macro with 1 parameter, prints out an ASCII char at current cursor position.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>GOTOXY col, row</B> - macro with 2 parameters, sets cursor position.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>PRINT string</B> - macro with 1 parameter, prints out a string.<BR><BR></LI>


<LI><B>PRINTN string</B> - macro with 1 parameter, prints out a string.
			The same as PRINT but automatically adds "carriage return" at the end of the string.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>CURSOROFF</B> - turns off the text cursor.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>CURSORON</B> - turns on the text cursor.<BR><BR></LI>


</UL>

To use any of the above macros simply type its name somewhere in your code,
and if required parameters, for example:<BR><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=10 WIDTH=50%><TR><TD>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
include emu8086.inc

ORG    100h

PRINT 'Hello World!'

GOTOXY 10, 5

PUTC 65           ; 65 - is an ASCII code for 'A'
PUTC 'B'

RET               ; return to operating system.
END               ; directive to stop the compiler.
</FONT></PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<BR><BR>

When compiler process your source code it searches the <B>emu8086.inc</B> file
for declarations of the macros and replaces the macro names with real code.
Generally macros are relatively small parts of code, frequent
use of a macro may make your executable too big (procedures are better
for size optimization).
<BR><BR>

<HR>

<BR>

<B>emu8086.inc</B> also defines the following <B>procedures</B>:<BR><BR>
<UL>

<LI><B>PRINT_STRING</B> - procedure to print a null terminated
 string at current cursor position,
 receives address of string in <B>DS:SI</B>
 register.
 To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_PRINT_STRING</B>
  before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>PTHIS</B> - procedure to print a null terminated
 string at current cursor position (just as PRINT_STRING),
 but receives address of string from Stack.
 The ZERO TERMINATED string should be defined just after
 the CALL instruction. For example:<BR><BR>
 <FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
 CALL PTHIS<BR>
 db 'Hello World!', 0<BR><BR>
 </FONT>
 To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_PTHIS</B>
  before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>GET_STRING</B> - procedure to get a null terminated
string from a user, the received string is written to buffer
at <B>DS:DI</B>, buffer size should be in <B>DX</B>.
Procedure stops the input when 'Enter' is pressed.
 To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_GET_STRING</B>
  before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>CLEAR_SCREEN</B> - procedure to clear the screen,
(done by scrolling entire screen window),
and set cursor position to top of it.
 To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_CLEAR_SCREEN</B>
  before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>SCAN_NUM</B> - procedure that
 gets the multi-digit SIGNED number from the keyboard,
 and stores the result in <B>CX</B> register.
 To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_SCAN_NUM</B>
 before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>PRINT_NUM</B> - procedure that prints a signed number in <B>AX</B> register.
To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_PRINT_NUM</B>
 <U>and</U> <B>DEFINE_PRINT_NUM_UNS</B> before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><B>PRINT_NUM_UNS</B> - procedure that prints out an unsigned
number in <B>AX</B> register.
 To use it declare: <B>DEFINE_PRINT_NUM_UNS</B>
  before <B>END</B> directive.<BR><BR></LI>

</UL>

<BR>
To use any of the above procedures you should first declare the
function in the bottom of your file (but before the <B>END</B> directive), and then
use <B>CALL</B> instruction followed by a procedure name.
For example:<BR><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=10 WIDTH=50%><TR><TD>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Fixedsys">
include 'emu8086.inc'

ORG    100h

LEA    SI, msg1       ; ask for the number
CALL   print_string   ;
CALL   scan_num       ; get number in CX.

MOV    AX, CX         ; copy the number to AX.

; print the following string:
CALL   pthis
DB  13, 10, 'You have entered: ', 0

CALL   print_num      ; print number in AX.

RET                   ; return to operating system.

msg1   DB  'Enter the number: ', 0

DEFINE_SCAN_NUM
DEFINE_PRINT_STRING
DEFINE_PRINT_NUM
DEFINE_PRINT_NUM_UNS  ; required for print_num.
DEFINE_PTHIS

END                   ; directive to stop the compiler.
</FONT></PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<BR><BR>
First compiler processes the declarations (these are just regular the macros
that are expanded to procedures). When compiler gets to <B>CALL</B>
instruction it replaces the procedure name with the address of the code
where the procedure is declared. When <B>CALL</B> instruction is executed control
is transferred to procedure. This is quite useful, since even if you
call the same procedure 100 times in your code you will still have relatively
small executable size. Seems complicated, isn't it? That's ok, with the
time you will learn more, currently it's required that you understand the
basic principle.
